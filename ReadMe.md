# Earpods Product Showcase Website
---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project presents a collection of different earpods products in a clean and user-friendly interface. Each product is displayed with high-quality images and can be explored using navigation buttons that smoothly scroll between sections. To enhance the visual experience, scale-up and scale-down animations are applied when switching between products, creating a dynamic and responsive feel.

A dedicated **Details** button is available for each product. When clicked, it opens a separate user interface section that displays detailed information about the selected earpods. This design helps users focus on product specifications and features without cluttering the main browsing area.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical front-end development skills such as DOM manipulation, animations, smooth scrolling behavior, and interactive UI design using only core web technologies.
